Evaluate
========

A function that evaluates a string as an equation. Originally I wrote it as part of an anser to Daily Progammers 135th easy
problem. However I spent far longer writing this function than the project called for because java has a built in
evaluate function. Since I spent so much time writing the function I figued I may as well make it useful in other 
circumstances. So I added the ability to work with paraenthesis and use division. It follows the order of operations.
